Facing the holidays can be daunting to anyone, especially if you're exhausted and feeling burn-out. The looming specter of faking holiday cheer is cringeworthy at best, particularly while trying to keep the peace. 

I'm here to ring the bell of HOPE! You don't have to continue to suffer through the insufferable today. If you're not putting yourself first then you probably have nothing to give to others. 

Here are 7 self-care tips for enjoying the holidays while nourishing your serenity.

### 1. Your Support Posse

Do you have a clawing creature in your heart that causes you to feel isolated when surrounded by others? It's time to soothe that inner roar instead of telling it to shut up. 

Are you going to a party, family gathering or a situation where you know you're going to be uncomfortable? Make sure to bring a trusted support person. If it's not ok for you to bring someone with you then you have the right to choose to not attend! You do *not* have to attend anything that you know will cause you discomfort.

Loneliness and the holidays go hand-in-hand sometimes. In preparation for that possibility, write a list, as a reminder of who's in your **Support Posse**. I suggest reaching out to them now to create a mutual support system. Trust me, you aren't the only one!

### 2. Exit Plan

How many times have you felt trapped in a place because you didn't take your own transportation or devise an exit strategy before arriving? It's the worst! Lets not re-create that scenario.

You can bestow yourself with the peace of mind by knowing ahead of time how you can leave when you need to. Knowing this will lessen hyper-sensitivity to triggers or acting out in ways you'd prefer not to.

If you decide against taking your own transportation then I encourage you to have ride-share apps ready and always have cash on hand if an actual taxi service is needed. You have the right to leave a place where you feel unsafe or disrespected. 

### 3. Health Routine

A holiday from work or school doesn't mean a holiday from who you are. Neglecting your normal routines, the very foundation of what makes you whole, can disrupt your equilibrium. 

Contine to maintain your daily routine even during the holidays. Give yourself and others the opportunity to be known and to know you. Your routine is intrinsic to who you are. Take a few minutes to write down what you do on a daily basis that gives you a sense of balance. 

A few examples of common daily routines may include number of meals, types of foods, needed medicine, bathing, exercise, prayer or meditation, socializing with your support posse, amount of sleep, hobbies, etc.

### 4. You are a Gift
