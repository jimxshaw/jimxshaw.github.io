I've been fascinated with computers, technology and the internet ever since my parents gifted me my first PC, a Compaq with an Intel Pentium II chip, back in the late-90s. 

I love finding and learning new things, especially with all things code-related.

On my site, I share what's on my mind, things I'm currently working on and what I plan to do in the future. I love to connect with folks of similar mindsets or even different mindsets and hope to hear from you.
