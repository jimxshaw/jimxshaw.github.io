I want to write code for the rest of my life.

Bold statement isn't it? There was a time when I wouldn't have even considered coding as a hobby, let alone a profession. Here's my story of how I became a coding enthusiast.

### Internship

I was an accounting major in college. I picked it not because I particularly enjoyed reading financial statements or balancing a ledger but because accountants were always employed and at the time the US economy was at the middle of the Great Recession. 

An investment bank hired me on as an intern in the summer of 2010 in their Broker-Dealer Services (BDS) group. Being a BDS intern was an eye-opening experience as I learned about the operations of a crucial piece of the whole bank. I loved it but then *something unexpected* happened. The VP of BDS, my manager, felt the group was performing well but that no one was taking notice. A way to increase visibility to our peers and to the higher ups was to have an internal Sharepoint site to promote our group. No site existed so I was tasked to build it from scratch.

Never in my life had I "coded" anything but my manager gave me a task and I couldn't fail him. I buckled down and started learning Microsoft Sharepoint. I designed, tested and deployed the BDS Sharepoint site to production in a week. We got the visibility we wanted because the VP of the Commercial Paper (CP) group took notice and asked my manager if I could create that group's Sharepoint site too. I gladly accepted and deployed the CP's Sharepoint shortly before the internship concluded. As far as I know those Sharepoints still exist to this day.

### Career Change

The bank gave me a full-time offer after the internship for an Application Support role in the Global Fee Billing group, supporting their various C#/.NET applications. This was a key moment in my life as I had to choose to either play it safe by continuing with accounting, I had an accounting degree after all, or possibly risk it all with a career change by joining IT. My Sharepoint experience showed that I'm capable of learning something new pretty quickly and then succeeding at it. So I took that risk based on my internship experience and accepted. During the day I learned about the SDLC, took requirements, wrote and executed UAT/PVT and queried with T-SQL in order to create reports for stakeholders. All the while at night I practiced coding, hoping that one day the bank would allow me to move from a support role to an actual development role.

A move wasn't possible as an IT Director flatout told me the bank and likely every other enterprise company in the US generally only take those with Computer Science degrees for developer roles. I left the bank in 2014 after 3 years to go back to school to pursue that piece of paper and vowed to be a software developer, be it with C#/.NET or something else, no matter what. Whatever it took to reach that developer summit I promised myself to do.
