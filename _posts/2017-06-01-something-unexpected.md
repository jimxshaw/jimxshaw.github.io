I want to write code for the rest of my life.

Bold statement isn't it? There was a time when I wouldn't have even considered coding as a hobby, let alone a profession. I was an accounting major in college. I picked it not because I particularly enjoyed reading financial statements or balancing a ledger but because accountants were always employed and at the time the US economy just hit the Great Recession. 

An investment bank hired me on as an intern that summer in their Broker-Dealer Services (BDS) group. It was my first true job, unless you count my tenure as a part-time Fry's Electronics salesman, hustling motherboards, routers, heatsinks and other hardware to customers who didn't necessarily want them. I digress. Being a BDS intern was an eye-opening experience as I learned about the operations of a crucial piece of the whole bank. I loved it but then *something unexpected* happened about halfway through the internship. The Senior VP of BDS, my manager, felt the group was performing well but that no one was taking notice. A way to increase visibility to our peers and to the higher ups was to have an internal Sharepoint site to promote our group. No site existed so I was tasked to build it from scratch.
