I want to write code for the rest of my life.

Bold statement isn't it? There was a time when I wouldn't have even considered coding as a hobby, let alone a profession. Here's my story of how I became a sofware developer and overall coding enthusiast.

### School

I was an accounting major in college. An investment bank hired me on as an intern in the summer of 2010 in their Broker-Dealer Services (BDS) group. Being a BDS intern was an eye-opening experience as I learned about the operations of a crucial piece of the whole bank. I enjoyed it but then *something unexpected* happened. The VP of BDS, my manager, felt the group was performing well but that no one was taking notice. A way to increase visibility to our peers and to the higher ups was to have an internal Sharepoint site to promote our group. No site existed so I was tasked to build it from scratch.

Never in my life had I "coded" anything but my manager gave me a task and I couldn't fail him. I buckled down and started learning Microsoft Sharepoint. I designed, tested and deployed the BDS Sharepoint site to production in a week. We got the visibility we wanted because the VP of the Commercial Paper (CP) group took notice and asked my manager if I could create that group's Sharepoint site too. I gladly accepted and deployed CP's Sharepoint shortly before the internship concluded. As far as I know those Sharepoint sites still exist to this day.

### Career Change

The bank gave me a full-time offer after the internship for an Application Support role in the Global Fee Billing group, supporting their various C#/.NET applications. This was a key moment as I had to choose to either play it safe by continuing with accounting or possibly risk it all with a career change by joining IT. My Sharepoint experience showed that I'm capable of learning something new pretty quickly and then succeeding at it. So I took that risk based on my internship experience and accepted. During the day I learned about the SDLC, took requirements, wrote and executed UAT/PVT and queried with T-SQL in order to create reports for stakeholders. All the while at night I practiced coding, hoping that one day the bank would allow me to move from a support role to an actual development role.

A move wasn't possible as an IT Director told me the bank and likely every other enterprise company in the US generally only take those with Computer Science degrees for developer roles. I left the bank in 2014 to go back to school to pursue that piece of paper and vowed to be a software developer, be it with C#/.NET or something else, no matter what. Whatever it took to reach that developer summit I promised myself to do.   

### Apprenticeship at The Software Guild

For a year I completed every Computer Science pre-requisite class imaginable, from coding (Java, C# etc.) to mathematics (Calculus, Discrete Math, Linear Algebra etc.) to the pure science (Physics etc.). However before I committed another 2+ years to the degree, I accepted an Apprenticeship at [The Software Guild][SoftwareGuild] in Ohio. The Apprenticeship taught me the practical side of software development using the latest .NET platform, ASP.NET 4.6 MVC 5 plus SQL Server. Me and a team of fellow apprentices designed, implemented, tested and deployed multiple MVC 5 applications under the guidance of Developer Leads and even a [Microsoft MVP][MSMVP]. Guild leaders emphasized and we ourselves internalized that a piece of paper doesn't define you and your skills. Your development work defines you. Period. 

### I, Software Developer

Within a couple of months of returning to Texas, I was doing side work in Android development and even a little Python. Had I ever done mobile development? No. Had I ever automated mundane tasks in Python? No. That didn't matter as I tried anyway, regardless how little the pay, or if at all. The Great One Wayne Gretzky said, "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." I took those shots again and again throughout the summer of 2016 until a company gave me a full-time opportunity as a C#/.NET developer. I finally summitted the mountain so-to-speak.

A successful summit of K2, "The Savage Mountain":

Was my mission to be a software developer complete? Yes but that's not good enough. Technology is ever changing. Code only moves in one direction, perpetually forward. There's no time to be complacent. 

Once again it's time for another mission: I will be a GREAT coder.

And I have the rest of my life to achieve it. 

Thank you and I hope you enjoy my blog.
