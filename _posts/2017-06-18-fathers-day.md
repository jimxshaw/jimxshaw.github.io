![Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying][livingordying]

Happy Father's Day everyone! I took my dad to his favorite steak house tonight. He got his usual 24 oz. porterhouse with greenbeans and seasoned rice. Nothing beats the porterhouse if you want both quality and quantity. We were eating and chatting away about our day. [Shawshank Redemption][shawshank] starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins was on tv and my dad sat down and watched the whole thing. We both love that movie and each has seen it about a dozen times. Aside from the brilliant acting, score and screenplay my dad revealed he especially holds Shawshank in his heart because it was the first movie he ever saw in theaters after arriving in the United States. The revelation surprised me as I never heard this before. For the rest of dinner my dad told the entire story of him coming to the US. 

### The Promise
In the early 90s, our family was living in Shanghai. My dad was teaching physics at a local university while my mom was taking care of infant me while working as a part-time architect. Life was simply ok, neither lavish nor impoverished. Good enough wasn't good enough for my dad though. He wanted us to live the American dream so he promised to get our family to the US no matter what. First, he buckled down and learned English. Second, he crushed the [TOEFL][toefl] and [GRE][gre] exams with a perfect score on the former and 90th percentile score on the latter. Plan going smoothly right? Not quite as there still was a fair amount of strategy and luck involved.

Applying to big name US graduate schools was out of the question because they were expensive and highly selective. My dad surgically targeted about five medium sized public universities in the American midwest. A key reason for choosing the midwest was because those schools had very few foreign grad students and even fewer ones who majored in physics. The gamble paid off as my dad was accepted into all of them and he chose the one that offered the most in scholarships.

### Visa
US Consulate in Shanghai:

The final step was to get an actual US visa, which involved going to the US Consulate in Shanghai for an in-person interview. My dad arrived at the specified date and time and waited in line for about 6 hours for his "interview". The visa process appeared arbitrary and subjective. A candidate walked up to a window and spoke with a consulate person. The person asked the candidate several questions like "What do you do? Why do you want to come to the United States? etc." Based on the candidate's answers he/she could be rejected for a good reason, bad reason or no reason at all. The consulate never stated the reason either. It was a simple stamp of approve or reject at the sole discretion of the consulate person sitting at the window at that time.

While waiting in line, my dad chatted with a guy immediately in front of him who also wanted to attend grad school in the US. This guy's background was exceptional: perfect TOEFL, perfect GRE, 100% full-ride scholarship to UC Berkley for biology. No doubt he'd be approved. So it wouldn't look good for my dad to be the next person the consulate person meets after he met the picture perfect grad student candidate. My dad was aware of this and asked to switch spots. Mr. Perfect Candidate was nice enough to agree. Situation averted.

Students who wanted to attend US schools were always asked, "How do you pay for school and your living expenses." Those who couldn't prove they had the means to support themselves were always rejected. To get around this my relatives pooled their money and temporarily transfered about $50,000 in to my dad's bank account on the day of his consulate visit. When asked that question, his massive bank balance served as "proof" that he had the money to pay for school. 

The consulate person approved my dad, Mr. Perfect Candidate behind him and a few others out of about 60 people that day. My mom noted that was one of the happiest days of my dad's life.
