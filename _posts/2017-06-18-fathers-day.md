![Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying][livingordying]

Happy Father's Day everyone! I took my dad to his favorite steak house tonight. He got his usual 24 oz. porterhouse with greenbeans and seasoned rice. Nothing beats the porterhouse if you want both quality and quantity. We were eating and chatting away about our day. [Shawshank Redemption][shawshank] starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins was on tv and my dad sat down and watched the whole thing. We both love that movie and each has seen it about a dozen times. Aside from the brilliant acting, score and screenplay my dad revealed he especially holds Shawshank in his heart because it was the first movie he ever saw in theaters after arriving in the United States. The revelation surprised me as I never heard this before. For the rest of dinner my dad told the entire story of him coming to the US. 

In the early 90s, our family was living in Shanghai. My dad was teaching physics at a local university while my mom was taking care of infant me while working as a part-time architect. Life was simply ok, neither lavish nor impoverished. Good enough wasn't good enough for my dad though. He wanted us to live the American dream so he promised to get our family to the US no matter what. First, he buckled down and learned English. Second, he crushed the [TOEFL][toefl] and [GRE][gre] exams with a perfect score on the former and 94th percentile score on the latter. Plan going smoothly right? Not quite as there still was a fair amount of strategy and luck involved.

Applying to big name US graduate schools was out of the question because they were expensive and highly selective. My dad surgically targeted about five medium sized public universities in the American midwest. A key reason for choosing the midwest was because those schools had very few foreign grad students and even fewer ones who major in physics. The gamble paid off as my dad was accepted to all of them and he chose the one that offered the most in scholarship money.
