![Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying][livingordying]

Happy Father's Day everyone! I took my dad to his favorite steak house tonight. He got his usual 24 oz. porterhouse with greenbeans and seasoned rice. Nothing beats the porterhouse if you want both quality and quantity. We were eating and chatting away about our day. [Shawshank Redemption][shawshank] starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins was on tv and my dad sat down and watched the whole thing. We both love that movie and each has seen it about a dozen times. Aside from the brilliant acting, the score and the screenplay my dad revealed he especially holds Shawshank in his heart because it was the first movie he ever saw in theaters after arriving in the United States. The revelation surprised me as I never heard this before. For the rest of dinner my dad told the entire story of him coming to the US.
