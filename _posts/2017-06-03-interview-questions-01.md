![Technical Interview][TechnicalInterview]

For you future software developers out there, your first interview can be tough. Here are some common entry level interview questions and answers. Most of the questions are about C#/.NET and SQL Server, as I'm most familiar with those technologies. Use this as an overview. Be sure to dig deeper and to broaden your scope to topics not covered here in order to get a more thorough understanding.

I plan on having more coding interview posts in the future. It'll be a continuing series so check back periodically.

### 1. Describe SQL

SQL or Structured Query Language is the language used to access and manipulate databases and data within databases. Microsoft SQL Server uses a specific kind of Structured Query Language called Transact-SQL or T-SQL. 

### 2. What's a SQL view?

A view is the virtual result set of a pre-written SQL query. That result set can then itself be queried against. Views are virtual because they don't actually exist as part of a database schema. They're dynamically generated only when requested.

```sql
-- Example view.
CREATE VIEW vwCustomersAndOrders
AS
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    tblCustomers AS C 
        INNER JOIN tblOrders AS O ON C.ID = O.CustomerID
GO
```

### 3. Describe a primary key and an identity column

A primary key (PK) is the unique identifier of a table record. An identity column has values auto-generated by the database itself. Primary key columns are commonly identity columns.

```sql
-- Example table with primary key column and identity 
-- column starting at 1 and auto-increments by 1.
CREATE TABLE tblCars (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1, 1),
    Make VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL,
    Model VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL
)
```

### 4. What do T-SQL LEFT() and RIGHT() functions do?

LEFT() takes a certain number of character(s) from the input string starting from the left-most character.

RIGHT() takes a certain number of characters(s) from the input string starting from the right-most character.

```sql
SELECT LEFT('Better angels of our nature', 4) -- Bett
SELECT RIGHT('We the people', 2) -- le
```

### 5. Elaborate on DROP, DELETE and TRUNCATE

When you DROP a table, the table itself and all records within it are removed from the database. 

Issuing a DELETE statement on a table removes all records from that table. DELETE does not reset the table's identity column.

When you TRUNCATE a table, all records are removed from that table and the table's identity column is reset.

```sql
DELETE FROM tblEmployees
WHERE LastName = 'Smith' -- Remove Employees with the last name of Smith.

TRUNCATE TABLE tblEmployees -- Removes all Employees table data and resets identity column.

DROP TABLE tblEmployees -- Removes the Employees table complete from the database.
```

### 6. What is a RESTful web API?

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It's an architectural style meant to convey how a well-designed web application should behave through various constraints. A web API that abides by any of REST's constraints is considered to be RESTful. A web API that abides by all of REST's constraints is a true REST web API.

6 REST constraints:
- Client-Server: A clear separation between the Client and the Server.
- Statelessness: The necessary state to handle every request is contained within the request itself.
- Cacheable: Each response must explicitly state whether or not it can be cached or not.
- Layered System: When a solution is comprised of multiple architectural layers, no one layer can directly access a layer that's beyond the next one.
- Code on Demand: A server can extend or customize client functionality by transferring executable code.
- Uniform Interface: The API and API consumers share one single technical interface such as URI, HTTP methods and HTTP media types.

I'll write a future blog post dedicated to REST that provides more detail.

### 7. What's an API resource? Describe its connection to routing

Resources represent real world entities. If our API were a online store then resources would be Customers, Orders, Items, Invoices, Payments etc. like in an actual physical store. Resource relationships are usually nested, where a Customer has many Orders and those Orders have their own order Items. Resources work hand-in-hand with routing through the use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). For example, if you want to retrieve all Orders for a particular Customer then your API routing would utilize the following URI: http://.../api/Customers/42/Orders. This route can be generalized with {resource1}/{id1}/{resource2}/{id2} and so on.

### 8. What's Attribute Routing?

ASP.NET MVC Routes are defined in RouteConfig.cs. For large projects, enterprise level projects for example, conventional routing is not enough. Special routing scenarios arise where it's tough to keep track of all those routes in a single file. Routes are physically separated from the controllers of which they belong with conventional routing. Developers may have to become Sherlock Holmes, the world's greatest detective, to be able to decipher and understand the relationships. Attribute routing was created to give developers a better experience.
