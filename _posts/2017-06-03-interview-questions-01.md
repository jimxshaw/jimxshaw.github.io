![Technical Interview][TechnicalInterview]

For you future software developers out there, your first interview can be tough. Here are some common interview questions and answers. Most of the questions are about C#/.NET and SQL Server, as I'm most familiar with those technologies. Use this as an overview. Be sure to dig deeper and to broaden your scope to topics not covered here in order to get a more thorough understanding.

I plan on having more coding interview posts in the future. It'll be a continuing series so check back periodically.

### 1. Describe SQL

SQL or Structured Query Language is the language used to access and manipulate databases and data within databases. Microsoft SQL Server uses a specific kind of Structured Query Language called Transact-SQL or T-SQL. 

### 2. What's a SQL view?

A view is the virtual result set of a pre-written SQL query. That result set can then itself be queried against. Views are virtual because they don't actually exist as part of a database schema. They're dynamically generated only when requested.

```sql
-- Example view.
CREATE VIEW vwCustomersAndOrders
AS
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    tblCustomers AS C 
        INNER JOIN tblOrders AS O ON C.ID = O.CustomerID
GO
```

### 3. Describe a primary key and an identity column

A primary key (PK) is the unique identifier of a table record. An identity column has values auto-generated by the database itself. Primary key columns are commonly identity columns.

```sql
-- Example table with primary key column and identity 
-- column starting at 1 and auto-increments by 1.
CREATE TABLE tblCars (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1, 1),
    Make VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL,
    Model VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL
)
```

### 4. What do T-SQL LEFT() and RIGHT() functions do?

LEFT() takes a certain number of character(s) from the input string starting from the left-most character.

RIGHT() takes a certain number of characters(s) from the input string starting from the right-most character.

```sql
SELECT LEFT('Better angels of our nature', 4) -- Bett
SELECT RIGHT('We the people', 2) -- le
```

### 5. Elaborate on DROP, DELETE and TRUNCATE

When you DROP a table, the table itself and all records within it are removed from the database. 

Issuing a DELETE statement on a table removes all records from that table. DELETE does not reset the table's identity column.

When you TRUNCATE a table, all records are removed from that table and the table's identity column is reset.

```sql
DELETE FROM tblEmployees
WHERE LastName = 'Smith' -- Remove Employees with the last name of Smith.

TRUNCATE TABLE tblEmployees -- Removes all Employees table data and resets identity column.

DROP TABLE tblEmployees -- Removes the Employees table complete from the database.
```

### 6. What is a RESTful web API?

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It's an architectural style meant to convey how a well-designed web application should behave through various constraints. A web API that abides by any of REST's constraints is considered to be RESTful. A web API that abides by all of REST's constraints is a true REST web API.

6 REST constraints:
- Client-Server: A clear separation between the Client and the Server.
- Statelessness: The necessary state to handle every request is contained within the request itself.
- Cacheable: Each response must explicitly state whether or not it can be cached or not.
- Layered System: When a solution is comprised of multiple architectural layers, no one layer can directly access a layer that's beyond the next one.
- Code on Demand: A server can extend or customize client functionality by transferring executable code.
- Uniform Interface: The API and API consumers share one single technical interface such as URI, HTTP methods and HTTP media types.

I'll write a future blog post dedicated to REST that provides more detail.

### 7. What's an API resource? Describe its connection to routing

Resources represent real world entities. If our API were a online store then resources would be Customers, Orders, Items, Invoices, Payments etc. like in an actual physical store. Resource relationships are usually nested, where a Customer has many Orders and those Orders have their own order Items. Resources work hand-in-hand with routing through the use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). For example, if you want to retrieve all Orders for a particular Customer then your API routing would utilize the following URI: http://.../api/Customers/42/Orders. This route can be generalized with {resource1}/{id1}/{resource2}/{id2} and so on.

### 8. What's Attribute Routing?

ASP.NET MVC Routes are defined in RouteConfig.cs. For large projects, enterprise level projects for example, conventional routing is not enough. Special routing scenarios arise where it's tough to keep track of all those routes in a single file. Routes are physically separated from the controllers of which they belong with conventional routing. Developers may have to become Sherlock Holmes, the world's greatest detective, to be able to decipher and understand the relationships. Attribute routing was created to give developers a better experience.  

```cs
// With attribute routing, routes can be placed directly
// on the controller or actions.
[RoutePrefix("Vendor")]
public class HomeController: Controller 
{
    // route: Vendor/Index
    public ActionResult Index() 
    {
        ViewBag.Message = "This is the Vendor portal's home index";
        return View();
    }
}

public class HomeController: Controller
{
    [Route("Employees/About")]
    public ActionResult About() 
    {
        ViewBag.Message = "Learn more about our employees!";
        return View();
    }
}
```   

### 9. What's MVC?

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a popular design pattern used to create web applications. Microsoft has two latest MVC flavors of its own: ASP.NET 4.6 MVC 5 and ASP.NET Core MVC. 

I'll use a movie analogy to better illustrate what MVC is.

- Model: Models are your actors. They often represent a real world entity, such as Customer, Order, Invoice etc. There's generally one C# class per model.
- View: Views are the scenes where your actors reside. The UI that the outside world interacts with is your view. A view typically needs to display data and the entity models that are bound to your view holds the data. MVC 5 Views comprise of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and rendered by the Razor View Engine.
- Controller: You have your actors and your scenes prepared but how do you fit the pieces together to form a movie. You need a director of course! The controller is the director of your MVC application. It contains the logic that determine which models are bound to which views and how operations that result from user interactions get handled.        

### 10. Give a brief summary of the .NET Framework

![.NET Framework][.NET]

Two crucial pieces of the .NET Framework are the Framework Class Library (FCL) and the Common Language Runtime (CLR). 

- FCL: The FCL is a massive collection of previously built code and types. It has all built-in types, arrays, exceptions, math libraries, File I/O, security, collections, reflection, threading, networking and so on. Even more general functionality classes for database access or GUI creation like WinForms and WPF are included. Many of these classes form the foundation of applications created for the Windows platform.
- CLR: In order for a language to be compatible with .NET, like C# for example, C#'s compiler can't simply compile C# source code down to general assembly language. It must compile down to a special type of assembly language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL). The CLR is .NET's virtual machine that accepts CIL and compiles it down to binary instructions that all Windows platform hardware can understand. If you want to add a new language to .NET then all you need is a new compiler with the ability to compile down to CIL. Once your source code exists in CIL then the CLR will take care of the rest as far as running that code. You, the developer, shouldn't have to worry about hardware architectures or operating systems. The CLR takes care of memory management for you as well.
