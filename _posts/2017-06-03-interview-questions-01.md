![Technical Interview][TechnicalInterview]

Here are some software developer interview questions that employers asked me over the years and my answers to them. Most of the questions are about C#/.NET and SQL Server, as I'm most familiar with those technologies. 

#### 1. Describe SQL

SQL or Structured Query Language is the language used to access and manipulate databases and data within databases. Microsoft SQL Server uses a specific kind of Structured Query Language called Transact-SQL or T-SQL. 

#### 2. What's a SQL view?

A view is the virtual result set of a pre-written SQL query. That result set can then itself be queried against. Views are virtual because they don't actually exist as part of a database schema. They're dynamically generated only when requested.

```sql
-- Example view.
CREATE VIEW vwCustomersAndOrders
AS
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    tblCustomers AS C 
        INNER JOIN tblOrders AS O ON C.ID = O.CustomerID
GO
```

#### 3. Describe a primary key and an identity column

A primary key (PK) is the unique identifier of a table record. An identity column has values auto-generated by the database itself. Primary key columns are commonly identity columns.

```sql
-- Example table with primary key column and identity 
-- column starting at 1 and auto-increments by 1.
CREATE TABLE tblCars (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1, 1),
    Make VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL,
    Model VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL
)
```

#### 4. What do T-SQL LEFT() and RIGHT() functions do?

LEFT() takes a certain number of character(s) from the input string starting from the left-most character.

RIGHT() takes a certain number of characters(s) from the input string starting from the right-most character.

```sql
SELECT LEFT('Better angels of our nature', 4) -- Bett
SELECT RIGHT('We the people', 2) -- le
```

#### 5. Elaborate on DROP, DELETE and TRUNCATE

When you DROP a table, the table itself and all records within it are removed from the database. 

Issuing a DELETE statement on a table removes all records from that table. DELETE does not reset the table's identity column.

When you TRUNCATE a table, all records are removed from that table and the table's identity column is reset.

```sql
DELETE FROM tblEmployees
WHERE LastName = 'Smith' -- Remove Employees with the last name of Smith.

TRUNCATE TABLE tblEmployees -- Removes all Employees table data and resets identity column.

DROP TABLE tblEmployees -- Removes the Employees table complete from the database.
```

#### 6. What is a RESTful web API?

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It's an architectural style meant to convey how a well-designed web application should behave through various constraints. A web API that abides by any of REST's constraints is considered to be RESTful. A web API that abides by all of REST's constraints is a true REST web API.

6 REST constraints:
- Client-Server: A clear separation between the Client and the Server.
- Statelessness: The necessary state to handle every request is contained within the request itself.
- Cacheable: Each response must explicitly state whether or not it can be cached or not.
- Layered System: When a solution is comprised of multiple architectural layers, no one layer can directly access a layer that's beyond the next one.
- Code on Demand: A server can extend or customize client functionality by transferring executable code.
- Uniform Interface: The API and API consumers share one single technical interface such as URI, HTTP methods and HTTP media types.

I'll dive deeper in a future blog post dedicated to REST.
