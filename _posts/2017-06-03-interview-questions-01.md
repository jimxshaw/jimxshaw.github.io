Here are some software developer interview questions that employers asked me over the years and my answers to them. Most of the questions are about C# and .NET, as those technologies are of which I'm most familiar. 

#### 1. Describe SQL

SQL or Structured Query Language is the language used to access and manipulate databases and data within databases. Microsoft SQL Server uses a specific kind of Structured Query Language called Transact-SQL or T-SQL. 

#### 2. What's a SQL view?

A view is the virtual result set of a pre-written SQL query. That result set can then itself be queried against. Views are virtual because they don't actually exist as part of a database schema. They're dynamically generated only when requested.

```sql
-- Example view.
CREATE VIEW vwCustomersAndOrders
AS
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    tblCustomers AS C 
        INNER JOIN tblOrders AS O ON C.ID = O.CustomerID
GO
```

#### 3. Describe a primary key and an identity column

A primary key (PK) is the unique identifier of a table record. An identity column has values auto-generated by the database itself. Primary key columns are commonly identity columns.

```sql
-- Example table with primary key column and identity 
-- column starting at 1 and auto-increments by 1.
CREATE TABLE tblCars (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1, 1),
    Make VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL,
    Model VARCHAR(55) NOT NULL
)
```

#### 4. What do T-SQL LEFT() and RIGHT() functions do?

LEFT() takes a certain number of character(s) from the input string starting from the left-most character.

RIGHT() takes a certain number of characters(s) from the input string starting from the right-most character.

```sql
SELECT LEFT('Better angels of our nature', 4) -- Bett
SELECT RIGHT('We the people', 2) -- le
```
